        Pico                One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
        Fermi               One digit is correct and in the right position.
        Bagels              No digit is correct.
        For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
        clues would be Fermi Pico.'''.format(NUM_DIGITS))
